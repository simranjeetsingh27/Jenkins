## TO DO

#### In this lab, we will create a shared library to implement Java CI:-
##### - Create a shared library that includes these stages
#####    - Code stability
#####    - Code quality
#####    - Code coverage
##### - Add a stage to publish the report for code quality and coverage
##### - Add a stage for workspace cleanup,
##### - The shared library should take branch name and git URL as the argument
##### - Instead of writing code in Jenkins pipeline box, keep the code in form of Jenkinsfile at VCS

#### We have done our configuration in pipeline like this.
